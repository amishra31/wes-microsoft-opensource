# Python Coding Puzzles

Welcome to the Python Coding Puzzles repository! This collection contains 20 coding challenges designed to help students learn debugging and problem-solving skills.

## About These Puzzles

Each puzzle contains either:
- **A bug to fix**: Find and correct the error in the code
- **Missing implementation**: Complete the function based on the requirements

The puzzles cover fundamental Python concepts including:
- Arithmetic operations
- String manipulation
- List operations
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Exception handling
- Type conversions
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)

## Difficulty Levels

- **Easy**: 10 puzzles - Basic syntax and logic errors
- **Medium**: 10 puzzles - More complex logic and implementation tasks

## How to Use These Puzzles

**Option 1: Work with GitHub Issues (Recommended)**

Browse the [puzzle issues](https://github.com/amishra31/wes-microsoft-opensource/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Apuzzle) and pick one to solve:
- [Easy puzzles](https://github.com/amishra31/wes-microsoft-opensource/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Apuzzle+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) - Great for beginners
- [Medium puzzles](https://github.com/amishra31/wes-microsoft-opensource/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Apuzzle+label%3Adifficulty%3Amedium) - More challenging

Each issue contains complete instructions and can be used to track your progress.

**Option 2: Work Directly with Files**

1. **Read the description**: Each puzzle file contains a detailed description of what the function should do
2. **Look at the expected output**: Test cases show what the correct output should be
3. **Find and fix the bug** or **implement the missing code**
4. **Run the file**: Execute the Python file to test your solution
   ```bash
   python puzzle_01_addition.py
   ```
5. **Verify the output**: Compare your output with the expected output

## Tips for Success

1. **Read error messages carefully**: Python error messages are very helpful
2. **Use print statements**: Add print statements to debug your code
3. **Test incrementally**: Make small changes and test frequently
4. **Understand the logic**: Don't just guess - understand why the bug exists
5. **Check the solutions file**: If you're stuck, refer to `SOLUTIONS.md` for hints
