Puzzle 29: Recursive Function Implementation
Difficulty: Hard

Description:
This function should calculate factorial recursively (n! = n * (n-1)!),
but it's not implemented yet! Implement the recursive logic.

Expected Output:
factorial(5) should return 120
factorial(3) should return 6
factorial(0) should return 1
