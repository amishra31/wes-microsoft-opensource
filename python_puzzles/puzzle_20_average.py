Puzzle 20: Mathematical Formula Implementation
Difficulty: Medium

Description:
This function should calculate the average of a list of numbers,
but it's not implemented yet! Calculate sum divided by count.

Expected Output:
calculate_average([10, 20, 30]) should return 20.0
calculate_average([5, 10, 15, 20]) should return 12.5
