## Python Coding Puzzles

This repository contains 20 Python coding puzzles designed to help students learn debugging and problem-solving skills. Each puzzle contains either a bug to fix or missing code to implement.

### Getting Started

Navigate to the `python_puzzles` directory to find all the puzzles:

```bash
cd python_puzzles
```

Read the [Python Puzzles README](python_puzzles/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to use the puzzles.

### What You'll Learn

- Debugging common programming errors
- Understanding Python syntax and semantics
- Working with different data types and structures
- Implementing algorithms and logic
- Reading and fixing code written by others

### Quick Start

1. Choose a puzzle from the `python_puzzles` directory
2. Read the description and expected output
3. Find and fix the bug or implement the missing code
4. Run the file to test your solution:
   ```bash
   python puzzle_01_addition.py
   ```
5. Check if your output matches the expected output

Good luck and happy coding! ðŸš€
