Repository to enable WES Foundation Students to understand Open Source contribution

## Python Coding Puzzles

This repository contains 20 Python coding puzzles designed to help students learn debugging and problem-solving skills. Each puzzle contains either a bug to fix or missing code to implement.

### Getting Started

Navigate to the `python_puzzles` directory to find all the puzzles:

```bash
cd python_puzzles
```

Read the [Python Puzzles README](python_puzzles/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to use the puzzles.

### What You'll Learn

- Debugging common programming errors
- Understanding Python syntax and semantics
- Working with different data types and structures
- Implementing algorithms and logic
- Reading and fixing code written by others

### Quick Start

**Option 1: Work on GitHub Issues (Recommended for Open Source Practice)**

Browse the [puzzle issues](https://github.com/amishra31/wes-microsoft-opensource/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Apuzzle) and:
1. Filter by difficulty: [`difficulty:easy`](https://github.com/amishra31/wes-microsoft-opensource/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Apuzzle+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) or [`difficulty:medium`](https://github.com/amishra31/wes-microsoft-opensource/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Apuzzle+label%3Adifficulty%3Amedium)
2. Choose an issue that interests you
3. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
4. Follow the instructions in the issue to solve the puzzle
5. Submit your solution

**Option 2: Work Directly from Files**

1. Choose a puzzle from the `python_puzzles` directory
2. Read the description and expected output
3. Find and fix the bug or implement the missing code
4. Run the file to test your solution:
   ```bash
   python puzzle_01_addition.py
   ```
5. Check if your output matches the expected output

### Difficulty Levels

- **Easy (9 puzzles)**: Basic syntax and logic errors - perfect for beginners
- **Medium (11 puzzles)**: More complex logic and implementation tasks

Good luck and happy coding! ðŸš€
